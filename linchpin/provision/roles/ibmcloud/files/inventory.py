        Returns a dict of hostnames or IP addresses for use in an Ansible
        inventory file, based on available data. Only a single hostname or IP
        address will be returned per instance, so as to avoid duplicate runs of
        Ansible on the same host via the generated inventory file.
        Each hostname contains mappings of any variable that was defined in the
        cfgs section of the PinFile (e.g. __IP__) to the value in the field that
        corresponds with that variable in the cfgs.
        If an instance has a public IP attached, its hostname in DNS will be
        returned if available, and if not the public IP address will be used.
        For instances which have a private IP address for VPC use cases, the
        private IP address will be returned since private EC2 hostnames (e.g.
        ip-10-0-0-1.ec2.internal) will not typically be resolvable outside of
        AWS. For instances with both a public and private IP address, the
        public address is always returned instead of the private address.
